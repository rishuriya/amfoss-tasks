## My Task Experience and approach
I would say that the task are from each domain of programming which i know. Though i am not completed all of them. Each task teach me something, As first time i learn about web scrapper, golang, flutter and downloading image through python. As i learned Java in higher secondary but still i very new to python and tried to do all my task in python.I really want to thanks hacktober event because it help me alot to complete Task-2. I tried Hackerrank Question for three consecutive day but get runtime error as i have to complete all task and then return to it again but i dont get time to come back for it. python cli task is my favourite task as i have interest in space and it give me chance to download exclusive image captured by nasa rover. First i downloaded the json file through api then extract it in my phython as dictionary and at end extracted the url of desire image from dictionary and download the image through URL. In Let me see i debug it and now it is running fine but i don`t know that it is giving appropriate result or not. Making An app is one of my dream which amfoss task give me chance to complete it. flutter own documentation help me alot. Rich scrapper task give me a problem as it is not installing in computer but after several attempt it installed successfully i, I googled about golang , read its documentation and completed the program. In my go script i wrote a array in which structure to be write in csv file and after running the program it create the csv file with the data written in that array. JSExplore task took time as i am misguided and think to parse data from the form in page-1 but mentor clarify me and then I completed the task of JSexplorer. Task-9 of making a personal website is is not personal it is a social media website i used php to do backend and bootstrap framework(my mentor advice me to upload this website in task)
