I make these website through googling but struck at some part where i need to take advice from senior) , I have taken informatics practices in Senior Secondary level and Best in my class but still I feel i am a begginer and I need more guidance and exposure. As i don`t get enough percentile to take CSE as my stream so amFOSS is my only chance to learn more in coding in which is my interest. i took Amritapuri campus even after not getting CSE only for amFOSS. And i really hope amFOSS make my technical side more confident.
